# Sentiment Analysis of Bengali Facebook Text using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

This project explores sentiment analysis on Bengali Facebook comments using both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. The goal is to classify user comments as positive, negative, or neutral, tackling challenges related to the morphological complexity of the Bengali language.

## üß† Models Implemented

* **Logistic Regression**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
* **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
* **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**

## üîç Highlights

* Custom Bengali dataset with labeled Facebook comments.
* Preprocessing steps: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and cleaning.
* Performance comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* CNN outperformed all models with \~72.7% accuracy.
